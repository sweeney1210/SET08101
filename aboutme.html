    <h1>Hello Web Tech</h1>
    <p>I am a 3rd year Cyber Security and Forensics student at Edinburgh Napier University. I am an avid football fan, following Celtic
      all over the country and europe. I have, in my spare time managed to teach myself the basics of web development last summer.
      While learning I managed to dreate, develop and host 2 websites which i still run to this day. The first website you will see listed
      below is my own perosnal website and the other is my uncles scaffolding company website. I have provided screenshots of both sites also. Thanks for taking the time to read.
